## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS hover state
- Google fonts
- Box-shadow
- 



### What I learned

I have learned about CSS flexbox in more details. I have learned CSS hover state, box-shadow and other properties as well. I learned how to use Google fonts in our projects.


```css
.container-box {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 13px;
    max-width:18.70rem;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin: 140px auto;
    box-shadow: 7px 7px;

} 


.learn:hover {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```





### Continued development

I want to practice more on flexbox and learn CSS Grid and Bootstrap also. I need to practice more to be comfortable in doing challenges.I



### Useful resources
